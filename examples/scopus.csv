A new generator loss function, least kth-order GAN (LkGAN), is introduced, generalizing the least squares GANs (LSGANs) by using a kth-order absolute error distortion measure with k ≥ 1 (which recovers the LSGAN loss function when k = 2). It is shown that minimizing this generalized loss function under an (unconstrained) optimal discriminator is equivalent to minimizing the kth-order Pearson-Vajda divergence. Another novel GAN generator loss function is next proposed in terms of Rényi cross-entropy functionals with order α > 0, α ≠ 1. It is demonstrated that this Rényi-centric generalized loss function, which provably reduces to the original GAN loss function as α → 1, preserves the equilibrium point satisfied by the original GAN based on the Jensen-Rényi divergence, a natural extension of the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Experimental results indicate that the proposed loss functions, applied to the MNIST and CelebA data sets, under both DCGAN and StyleGAN architectures, confer performance benefits by virtue of the extra degrees of freedom provided by the parameters k and α, respectively. More specifically, experiments show improvements with regard to the quality of the generated images as measured by the Fréchet inception distance score and training stability. While it was applied to GANs in this study, the proposed approach is generic and can be used in other applications of information theory to deep learning, for example, the issues of fairness or privacy in artificial intelligence. © 2021 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"Deep learning; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Image enhancement; Adversarial networks; Distortion measures; Equilibrium point; Improving performance; Information theoretic measure; Jensen-Shannon divergence; Natural extension; Performance benefits; Information theory; article; artificial intelligence; deep learning; degree of freedom; entropy; information science; least square analysis; loss of function mutation; privacy; theoretical study",,,,,,,,"Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Zheng, X., (2015) TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems, , https://www.tensorflow.org/; Achille, A., Soatto, S., (2019) Where is the information in a deep neural network?, , arXiv:1905.12213; Alajaji, F., Chen, P.-N., Rached, Z., Csiszár’s cutoff rates for the general hypothesis testing problem (2004) IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 50 (4), pp. 663-678; Alemi, A.

The GAN was trained and tested with a sequence of the satellite images of a COMS satellite infrared-window channel under the 68 tropical cyclones. The inputs of the consecutive satellite images with 15-min interval were then processed using the trained GAN model to generate satellite images in the next time steps. To further enhance the model's predictability, particle image velocimetry based on the theory of cross-correlation schemes was employed to the GAN-generated satellite image sequence and AMVs were produced. The GAN-derived AMVs were validated with the wind fields based on the numerical weather prediction (NWP) and radiosonde observations. The comparisons showed that the GAN-derived AMVs depicted the structure of atmospheric circulations with a certain level of accuracy. Through comparison with the radiosonde observations, the root-mean-square error and the wind speed bias of the GAN-derived AMVs were comparable to, and even smaller than those of the NWP-derived wind fields. The current approach may enhance the accuracy in predicting short-term wind velocity fields, which in turn may provide more realistic inputs in storm surge modeling. © 2021","Atmospheric motion vectors; Generative adversarial network; Particle image velocimetry; Satellite images; Wind velocity","Flow visualization; Hurricanes; Image enhancement; Mean square error; Radiosondes; Satellites; Storms; Velocimeters; Velocity; Weather forecasting; Wind; Adversarial networks; Atmospheric motion vectors; Generative adversarial network; Image velocimetry; Numerical weather prediction; Particle images; Radiosonde observations; Satellite images; Wind field; Wind velocities; Velocity measurement",,,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF: 2020R1C1C100513311, NRF-2019H1D3A1A0107072 2","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea ( NRF-2019H1D3A1A0107072 2) and the National Research Foundation of Korea ( 2020R1C1C100513311 ).",,"Abidi, M.A., Gonzalez, R.C., Cloud motion measurement from radar image sequences (1988) Proc.

All of them provide exponential combinations whose computational fitness is difficult to pinpoint. The intricate resemblance of the microscopic features that are found in bone surface modifications make their differentiation challenging, and determining a baseline combination of optimizers and activation functions for modeling seems necessary for computational economy. Here, we experiment with combinations of the most resolutive activation functions (relu, swish, and mish) and the most efficient optimizers (stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam) for bone surface modification analysis. We show that despite a wide variability of outcomes, a baseline of relu–SGD is advised for raw bone surface modification data. For imbalanced samples, augmented datasets generated through generative adversarial networks are implemented, resulting in balanced accuracy and an inherent bias regarding mark replication. In summary, although baseline procedures are advised, these do not prevent to overcome Wolpert’s “no free lunch” theorem and extend it beyond model architectures. © 2021 by the authors.

We apply image-to-image translation using conditional GANs to the mass map obtained from the first-year data of Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey. We train the conditional GANs by using 25 000 mock HSC catalogues that directly incorporate a variety of observational effects. We study the non-Gaussian information in denoised maps using one-point probability distribution functions (PDFs) and also perform matching analysis for positive peaks and massive clusters. An ensemble learning technique with our GANs is successfully applied to reproduce the PDFs of the lensing convergence. About 60 per cent of the peaks in the denoised maps with height greater than 5σ have counterparts of massive clusters within a separation of 6 arcmin. We show that PDFs in the denoised maps are not compromised by details of multiplicative biases and photometric redshift distributions, nor by shape measurement errors, and that the PDFs show stronger cosmological dependence compared to the noisy counterpart. We apply our denoising method to a part of the first-year HSC data to show that the observed mass distribution is statistically consistent with the prediction from the standard ΛCDM model. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","Cosmology: observations; Gravitational lensing: weak; Large-scale structure of Universe; Methods: data analysis",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: AST-1238877

While there are many analytic-based methods for diffraction imaging which use kinematic, dynamic or both, properties of the diffracted wavefield, they can be slow and require parameterization. Here, we propose an image-to-image generative adversarial network to automatically separate diffraction events on pre-migrated seismic data in a fraction of the time of conventional methods. To train the generative adversarial network, plane-wave destruction was applied to a range of synthetic and real images from field data to create training data. These training data were screened and any areas where the plane-wave destruction did not perform well, such as synclines and areas of complex dip, were removed to prevent bias in the neural network. A total of 14,132 screened images were used to train the final generative adversarial network. The trained network has been applied across several geologically distinct field datasets, including a 3D example. Here, generative adversarial network separation is shown to be comparable to a benchmark separation created with plane-wave destruction, and up to 12 times faster. This demonstrates the clear potential in generative adversarial networks for fast and accurate diffraction separation. © 2021 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers","Data processing; Imaging; Seismics","Elastic waves; Seismology; Separation; Adversarial networks; Conventional methods; Diffraction imaging; Plane wave destructions; Real images; Seismic datas; Seismic wavefields; Training data; Diffraction; artificial neural network; data processing; data set; image analysis; seismic data; seismic migration; seismic wave; wave diffraction; wave field",,,,,"Science Foundation Ireland, SFI: 13/RC/2092

DehazeGAN can be used for edge computing-based applications, such as roadside monitoring. It adopts two networks: one is generator (G), and the other is discriminator (D). The G adopts the U-Net architecture, whose layers are particularly designed to incorporate the atmospheric scattering model of image dehazing. By using a reformulated atmospheric scattering model, the weights of the generator network are initialized by the coarse transmission map, and the biases are adaptively adjusted by using the previous round's trained weights. Since the details may be blurry after the fog is removed, the contrast loss is added to enhance the visibility actively. Aside from the typical GAN adversarial loss, the pixel-wise Mean Square Error (MSE) loss, the contrast loss and the dark channel loss are introduced into the generator loss function. Extensive experiments on benchmark images, the results of which are compared with those of several state-of-the-art methods, demonstrate that the proposed DehazeGAN performs better and is more effective. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Atmospheric scattering model; Contrast loss; Dehazing; Edge computing applications",,,,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF

GANs have recently had particular success in applications involving high-dimensional distributions in areas such as image processing. Little work has been reported for low dimensions, where properties of GANs may be better identifed and understood. We studied GAN performance in simulated low-dimensional settings, allowing us to transparently assess effects of target distribution complexity and training data sample size on GAN performance in a simple experiment. This experiment revealed two important forms of GAN error, tail underflling and bridge bias, where the latter is analogous to the tunneling observed in high-dimensional GANs. © 2021 National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Consideration of rules is important for understanding how people behave-yet, it cannot be assumed that rules are always followed. To address this challenge, we evaluate different approaches of integrating rules as inductive biases into deep learning-based prediction models. We propose a framework based on generative adversarial networks that uses tools from formal methods, namely signal temporal logic and syntax trees. This allows us to leverage information on rule obedience as features in neural networks and improves prediction accuracy without biasing towards lawful behavior. We evaluate our method on a real-world driving dataset and show improvement in performance over off-The-shelf predictors. © 2016 IEEE.","Autonomous-driving; prediction; temporal logic","Agricultural robots; Deep learning; Forecasting; Formal methods; Predictive analytics; Syntactics; Temporal logic; Trees (mathematics); Adversarial networks; Inductive bias; Prediction accuracy; Prediction model; Real-world drivings; Traffic agents; Trajectory prediction; Vehicle trajectory predictions; Computer circuits",,,,,"Toyota Research Institute, TRI","Manuscript received October 15, 2020; accepted February 11, 2021.

Acquisition of speech has recently been modeled as a dependency between latent space and data generated by GANs in Beguš (2020b), who models learning of a simple local allophonic distribution. We extend this approach to test learning of local and non-local phonological processes that include approximations of morphological processes. We further parallel outputs of the model to results of a behavioral experiment where human subjects are trained on the data used for training the GAN network. Four main conclusions emerge: (i) the networks provide useful information for computational models of speech acquisition even if trained on a comparatively small dataset of an artificial grammar learning experiment; (ii) local processes are easier to learn than non-local processes, which matches both behavioral data in human subjects and typology in the world's languages. This paper also proposes (iii) how we can actively observe the network's progress in learning and explore the effect of training steps on learning representations by keeping latent space constant across different training steps. Finally, this paper shows that (iv) the network learns to encode the presence of a prefix with a single latent variable; by interpolating this variable, we can actively observe the operation of a non-local phonological process. The proposed technique for retrieving learning representations has general implications for our understanding of how GANs discretize continuous speech data and suggests that rule-like generalizations in the training data are represented as an interaction between variables in the network's latent space. © 2021 The Author(s)","Behavioral experiments; Learning biases; Machine learning; Morphology; Neural networks; Speech","Behavioral research; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Speech; Adversarial networks; Behavioral experiment; Computational model; Continuous speech; Grammar learning; Latent variable; Morphological process; Speech acquisition; Deep learning",,,,,"University of California Berkeley, UCB

Its capability of eliminating bias introduced inevitably by generic single-directional image registration allows more precise analysis in different interdisciplinary applications of image registration, e.g. computational anatomy and shape analysis. However, most existing symmetric registration techniques especially for multimodal images are limited by low speed from the commonly-used iterative optimization, hardship in exploring inter-modality relations or high labor cost for labeling data. We propose SymReg-GAN to shatter these limits, which is a novel generative adversarial networks (GAN) based approach to symmetric image registration. We formulate symmetric registration of unimodal/multimodal images as a conditional GAN and train it with a semi-supervised strategy. The registration symmetry is realized by introducing a loss for encouraging that the cycle composed of the geometric transformation from one image to another and its reverse should bring an image back. The semi-supervised learning enables both the precious labeled data and large amounts of unlabeled data to be fully exploited. Experimental results from 6 public brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets and 1 our own computed tomography (CT) &amp; MRI dataset demonstrate the superiority of SymReg-GAN to several existing state-of-the-art methods.

The credibility of such Monte Carlo studies is often limited because of the discretion the researcher has in choosing the Monte Carlo designs reported. To improve the credibility we propose using a class of generative models that has recently been developed in the machine learning literature, termed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which can be used to systematically generate artificial data that closely mimics existing datasets. Thus, in combination with existing real data sets, GANs can be used to limit the degrees of freedom in Monte Carlo study designs for the researcher, making any comparisons more convincing. In addition, if an applied researcher is concerned with the performance of a particular statistical method on a specific data set (beyond its theoretical properties in large samples), she can use such GANs to assess the performance of the proposed method, e.g. the coverage rate of confidence intervals or the bias of the estimator, using simulated data which closely resembles the exact setting of interest. To illustrate these methods we apply Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) to the estimation of average treatment effects. In this example, we find that (i) there is not a single estimator that outperforms the others in all three settings, so researchers should tailor their analytic approach to a given setting, (ii) systematic simulation studies can be helpful for selecting among competing methods in this situation, and (iii) the generated data closely resemble the actual data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,"Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Adversarial networks; Artificial data; Generative model; Machine learning literature; Monte Carlo's simulation; Performance; Property; Real data sets; Specific data sets; Study design; Monte Carlo methods",,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR: N00014-17-1-2131, N00014-19-1-2468

The task is difficult because of the bias problem, that is, unseen samples are easily to be misclassified to seen classes. Many methods have handled the problem by training a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate fake samples. However, the GAN model trained with seen samples might not be appropriate for generating unseen samples. For dealing with this problem, we learn a bias alleviating generative adversarial network for generalized zero-shot classification by generating seen and unseen samples, simultaneously. We train the generator to generate more realistic unseen samples by adding semantic similarity and cluster center regularizations to alleviate the bias problem. The semantic similarity regularization is to restrict the relationships of the generated unseen visual prototypes and seen visual prototypes by their class prototypes to avoid the generated unseen samples similar to the seen samples. The cluster center regularization is to utilize the cluster property of target data to make the generated unseen visual prototypes near to the most similar cluster centers, generating realistic unseen samples. From the experiments, we can see the proposed method achieves promising results. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cluster centers; Generalized zero shot classification; Generative adversarial network; Semantic relationships; Unseen visual prototypes","Computer applications; Electrical engineering; Adversarial networks; Bias problems; Cluster centers; Cluster property; Semantic similarity; Shot classification; Test images; Semantics",,,,,"1908085MF186

In real-world datasets, numerous class distributions are imbalanced and the classification result under such condition reveals extreme bias in the majority data class. Recently, the potential of GAN as a data augmentation method on minority data has been studied. In this paper, we propose a classification enhancement generative adversarial networks (CEGAN) to enhance the quality of generated synthetic minority data and more importantly, to improve the prediction accuracy in data imbalanced condition. In addition, we propose an ambiguity reduction method using the generated synthetic minority data for the case of multiple similar classes that are degenerating the classification accuracy. The proposed method is demonstrated with five benchmark datasets. The results indicate that approximating the real data distribution using CEGAN improves the classification performance significantly in data imbalanced conditions compared with various standard data augmentation methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ambiguous classes; Classification enhancement; Data augmentation; Generative adversarial networks; Imbalanced classification","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Adversarial networks; Benchmark datasets; Class distributions; Classification accuracy; Classification performance; Classification results; Prediction accuracy; Real-world datasets; Classification (of information); article; prediction; automated pattern recognition; classification; data analysis; human; procedures; Data Analysis; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Pattern Recognition, Automated",,,,,"12020","This research was supported by Korea Institute of Science and Technology Europe Institutional Program (Project No. 12020 ).",,"Arjovsky, M., Chintala, S., Bottou, L., (2017), Wasserstein generative adversarial networks.

The generator learns the model parameter values that produce fake images that best match the true images. Two case studies show excellent agreement between the generated best match parameters and the true parameters. The best match model parameter values can be used to retune the default simulation to minimize any bias when applying image recognition techniques to fake and true images. In the case of a real-world experiment, the true images are experimental data with unknown true model parameter values, and the fake images are produced by a simulation that takes the model parameters as input. The model-assisted GAN uses a convolutional neural network to emulate the simulation for all parameter values that, when trained, can be used as a conditional generator for fast fake-image production. © 2012 IEEE.","Fast simulation; generative adversarial networks (GANs); model-assisted GAN; parameter optimization","Image recognition; Adversarial networks; Best match; Case-studies; Image production; Image-based modeling; Model parameters; Real world experiment; Convolutional neural networks; article; convolutional neural network; image display; simulation",,,,,,,,"Goodfellow, I., Generative adversarial nets (2014) Proc.

Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) adds seen categories to the test samples. Since the learned classifier has inherent bias against seen categories, GZSL is more challenging than traditional ZSL. However, at present, there is no detailed attribute description dataset for video classification. Therefore, the current zero-shot video classification problem is based on the synthesis of generative adversarial networks trained on seen-class features into unseen-class features for ZSL classification. In order to solve this problem, we propose a description text dataset based on the UCF101 action recognition dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to add description of the classes to zero-shot video classification. We propose a new loss function that combines visual features with textual features. We extract text features from the proposed text data set, and constrain the process of generating synthetic features based on the principle that videos with similar text types should be similar. Our method reapplies the traditional zero-shot learning idea to video classification. From the experimental point of view, our proposed dataset and method have a positive impact on the generalized zero-shot video classification. © 2020 ACM.","computer vision; machine learning","Character recognition; Action recognition; Adversarial networks; Loss functions; Shot video classifications; Test samples; Textual features; Video classification; Visual feature; Classification (of information)",,,,,"QYZDJ-SSW-SYS013

They may be used to synthesize new samples or to subsequently extract representations. Successful approaches in the domain of images are driven by several core inductive biases. However, a bias to account for the compositional way in which humans structure a visual scene in terms of objects has frequently been overlooked. In this work, we investigate object compositionality as an inductive bias for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We present a minimal modification of a standard generator to incorporate this inductive bias and find that it reliably learns to generate images as compositions of objects. Using this general design as a backbone, we then propose two useful extensions to incorporate dependencies among objects and background. We extensively evaluate our approach on several multi-object image datasets and highlight the merits of incorporating structure for representation learning purposes. In particular, we find that our structured GANs are better at generating multi-object images that are more faithful to the reference distribution. More so, we demonstrate how, by leveraging the structure of the learned generative process, one can ‘invert’ the learned generative model to perform unsupervised instance segmentation. On the challenging CLEVR dataset, it is shown how our approach is able to improve over other recent purely unsupervised object-centric approaches to image generation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Compositionality; Generative Adversarial Networks; Generative modeling; Instance segmentation; Objects; Representation learning","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Adversarial networks; Compositionality; General designs; Generative model; Generative process; Image datasets; Image generations; Inductive bias; Image enhancement; article; feature learning (machine learning); human; automated pattern recognition; image processing; procedures; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neural Networks, Computer; Pattern Recognition, Automated",,,,,"International Business Machines Corporation, IBM

In order to address these limitations of genomic data, we develop a Population-scale Genomic Data Augmentation based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (PG-cGAN) to enhance the amount and diversity of genomic data by transforming samples already in the data rather than collecting new samples. Both the generator and discriminator in the PG-CGAN are stacked with convolutional layers to capture the underlying population structure. Our results for augmenting genotypes in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) regions showed that PC-cGAN can generate new genotypes with similar population structure, variant frequency distributions and LD patterns. Since the input for PC-cGAN is the original genomic data without assumptions about prior knowledge, it can be extended to enrich many other types of biomedical data and beyond. © 2020 ACM.","data augmentation; deep learning; generative adversarial networks; genomics; machine learning","Bioinformatics; Genes; Medical informatics; Metadata; Adversarial networks; Biomedical data; Frequency distributions; Human leukocyte antigen; Next-generation sequencing; Population structures; Prior knowledge; Privacy and security; Population statistics",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1750632","This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation of the United States (Award Number: 1750632).",,"Abadi, M., Chu, A., Goodfellow, I., Brendan McMahan, H., Mironov, I., Talwar, K., Zhang, L., 2016.

The use of high-quality whole-slide scanners enables the fast acquisition of large amounts of image data, showing extensive context and microscopic detail at the same time. Simultaneously, novel machine-learning algorithms have boosted the performance of image analysis approaches. In this paper, we focus on a particularly powerful class of architectures, the so-called generative adversarial networks (GANs) applied to histological image data. Besides improving performance, GANs also enable previously intractable application scenarios in this field. However, GANs could exhibit a potential for introducing bias. Hereby, we summarize the recent state-of-the-art developments in a generalizing notation, present the main applications of GANs, and give an outlook of some chosen promising approaches and their possible future applications. In addition, we identify currently unavailable methods with potential for future applications. The use of high-quality whole-slide scanners enables the fast acquisition of large amounts of image data, showing extensive context and microscopic detail at the same time. While manual examination of these images of considerable size is highly time consuming and error prone, state-of-the-art machine-learning approaches enable efficient, automated processing of whole-slide images. In this paper, we focus on a particularly powerful class of deep-learning architectures, the so-called generative adversarial networks. Over the past years, the high number of publications on this topic indicates a very high potential of generative adversarial networks in the field of digital pathology. In this survey, the most important publications are collected and categorized according to the techniques used and the aspired application scenario. We identify the main ideas and provide an outlook into the future. Whole-slide scanners digitize microscopic tissue slides and thereby generate a large amount of digital image material. This advocates for methods facilitating (semi-)automated analysis. In this paper, we investigate generative adversarial networks, which are a powerful class of deep-learning-based approaches, useful in, for example, histological image analysis. The most important publications in the field of digital pathology are collected, summarized, and categorized according to the technical approaches employed and the aspired application scenarios. We identify the main findings and furthermore provide an outlook. © 2020 The Authors","computational pathology; DSML 1: Concept: Basic principles of a new data science output observed and reported; generative adversarial network; histology; image-to-image translation; survey","Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network architecture; Pathology; Scanning; Surveys; Adversarial networks; Application scenario; Automated processing; Digital pathologies; Improving performance; Learning architectures; Learning-based approach; Machine learning approaches; Image analysis",,,,,"FHS-2019-10-KIAMed","This work was partially funded by the County of Salzburg under grant number FHS-2019-10-KIAMed .",,"Kooi, T., Litjens, G., van Ginneken, B., Gubern-Mérida, A., Sánchez, C.I., Mann, R., den Heeten, A., Karssemeijer, N., Large scale deep learning for computer aided detection of mammographic lesions (2017) Med.

The problem of the existing mitigation approaches is that they are model-oriented in the sense that they focus on tuning the training algorithms to produce fair results, while overlooking the fact that the training data can itself be the main reason for biased outcomes. Technically speaking, two essential limitations can be found in such model-based approaches: 1) the mitigation cannot be achieved without degrading the accuracy of the machine learning models, and 2) when the data used for training are largely biased, the training time automatically increases so as to find suitable learning parameters that help produce fair results. To address these shortcomings, we propose in this work a new framework that can largely mitigate the biases and discriminations in machine learning systems while at the same time enhancing the prediction accuracy of these systems. The proposed framework is based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), which are used to generate new synthetic fair data with selective properties from the original data. We also propose a framework for analyzing data biases, which is important for understanding the amount and type of data that need to be synthetically sampled and labeled for each population group. Experimental results show that the proposed solution can efficiently mitigate different types of biases, while at the same time enhance the prediction accuracy of the underlying machine learning model. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.",,"Population statistics; Adversarial networks; Learning parameters; Machine learning models; Model based approach; Prediction accuracy; Selective properties; Training algorithms; Training time; Machine learning",,,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","The financial support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada is gratefully acknowledged.

Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have also shown their superior performance in many computer vision tasks and attracted growing interests in medical imaging. In this work, the authors proposed a novel model [deep residual generative adversarial network (DRGAN)] based on GANs for the reduction of streaking artefacts and the improvement of PET image quality. An innovative feature of the proposed method is that the authors trained a generator to produce 'residual PET map' (RPM) for image representation, rather than generate PET images directly. DRGAN used two discriminators (critics) to enforce anatomically realistic PET images and RPM. To better boost the contextual information, the authors designed residual dense connections followed with pixel shuffle operations (RDPS blocks) that encourage feature reuse and prevent losing resolution. Both simulation data and real clinical PET data are used to evaluate the proposed method. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the quantification results show that DRGAN can achieve better performance in bias-variance trade-off and provide comparable image quality. Their results were rigorously evaluated by one radiologist at the Shanxi Cancer Hospital. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020",,"Economic and social effects; Image enhancement; Image quality; Inverse problems; Medical imaging; Positron emission tomography; Adversarial networks; Bias variance trade off; Contextual information; Image representations; PET image reconstruction; Physical effects; Positron emission tomography (PET); State-of-the-art methods; Image reconstruction",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 201801D121139, 61872261

Various studies have suggested that the prevalence of voice disorders in the general population is greater than 10%. An automatic diagnosis for voice disorders via machine learning algorithms is desired to reduce the cost and time needed for examination by doctors and speech-language pathologists. In this paper, a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) and improved fuzzy c-means clustering (IFCM) algorithm called CGAN-IFCM is proposed for the multi-class voice disorder detection of three common types of voice disorders. Existing benchmark datasets for voice disorders, the Saarbruecken Voice Database (SVD) and the Voice ICar fEDerico II Database (VOICED), use imbalanced classes. A generative adversarial network offers synthetic data to reduce bias in the detection model. Improved fuzzy c-means clustering considers the relationship between adjacent data points in the fuzzy membership function. To explain the necessity of CGAN and IFCM, a comparison is made between the algorithm with CGAN and that without CGAN. Moreover, the performance is compared between IFCM and traditional fuzzy c-means clustering. Lastly, the proposed CGAN-IFCM outperforms existing models in its true negative rate and true positive rate by 9.9-12.9% and 9.1-44.8%, respectively. © 2020 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Fuzzy c-means clustering; Generative adversarial network; Imbalanced dataset; Machine learning; Multi-class detection; Smart healthcare; Synthetic data; Voice disorders",,,,,,,,,"Vilkman, E., Voice problems at work: A challenge for occupational safety and health arrangement (2000) Folia Phoniatrica et Logopaedica, 52, pp. 120-125; Dodderi, T., Philip, N.E., Mutum, K., Prevalence of voice disorders in the Department of Speech Language Pathology of a tertiary care hospital of Mangaluru: A retrospective study of 11 years (2018) Nitte Univ.

A model trained with imbalanced data tends to bias towards healthy data which is not desired in clinical applications and predicted outputs by these networks have high precision and low recall. To mitigate imbalanced training data impact, we train RNN-GAN with proposed complementary segmentation mask, in addition, ordinary segmentation masks. The RNN-GAN consists of two components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator is trained on the sequence of medical images to learn corresponding segmentation label map plus proposed complementary label both at a pixel level, while the discriminator is trained to distinguish a segmentation image coming from the ground truth or from the generator network. Both generator and discriminator substituted with bidirectional LSTM units to enhance temporal consistency and get inter and intra-slice representation of the features. We show evidence that the proposed framework is applicable to different types of medical images of varied sizes. In our experiments on ACDC-2017, HVSMR-2016, and LiTS-2017 benchmarks we find consistently improved results, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Imbalanced medical image semantic segmentation; Recurrent generative adversarial network","Image segmentation; Long short-term memory; Pixels; Semantic Web; Semantics; Adversarial networks; Clinical application; Image semantics; Imbalance datum; Imbalanced data; Segmentation images; Segmentation masks; Temporal consistency; Medical image processing",,,,,"Universität Potsdam, UP: Hasso Plattner Institute",,,"Abadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G.S., Zheng, X., (2015) Tensorflow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Systems, , https://www.tensorflow.org/.Softwareavailablefromtensorflow.org; Afshin, M., Ayed, I.B., Punithakumar, K., Law, M., Islam, A., Goela, A., Peters, T., Li, S., Regional assessment of cardiac left ventricular myocardial function via mri statistical features (2014) IEEE Trans Med Imaging, 33 (2), pp. 481-494; Avola, D., Cinque, L., Encephalic nmr image analysis by textural interpretation (2008) Proceedings of the 2008 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 1338-1342. , ACM; Avola, D., Cinque, L., Di Girolamo, M., A novel t-cad framework to support medical image analysis and reconstruction (2011) International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing, pp. 414-423. , Springer; Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., Cervenansky, F., Yang, X., Heng, P.A., Cetin, I., Ballester, M.A.G., Deep learning techniques for automatic mri cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: Is the problem solved?

Although augmented reality is not a new concept but it has gained much needed attention over the past few years. Our present work is targeted towards this direction which may be used to enhance user experience in various virtual and augmented reality based applications. We propose a model to change skin tone of a person. Given any input image of a person or a group of persons with some value indicating the desired change of skin color towards fairness or darkness, this method can change the skin tone of the persons in the image. This is an unsupervised method and also unconstrained in terms of pose, illumination, number of persons in the image etc. The goal of this work is to reduce the time and effort which is generally required for changing the skin tone using existing applications (e.g., Photoshop) by professionals or novice. To establish the efficacy of this method we have compared our result with that of some popular photo editor and also with the result of some existing benchmark method related to human attribute manipulation. Rigorous experiments on different datasets show the effectiveness of this method in terms of synthesizing perceptually convincing outputs. © 2020 IEEE",,"Augmented reality; Sales; User experience; Adversarial networks; Augmented and virtual realities; Human attributes; Input image; Photo editors; Unsupervised approaches; Unsupervised method; Virtual and augmented reality; Pattern recognition",,,,,,,,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality; https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/10/23/238473/augmentedreality-in-retail-virtual-try-before-you-buy/; https://retailwire.com/discussion/; https://p4t6u7k5.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock605616227.jpg; https://designpanoply.com/blog/how-to-change-a-persons-skin-color-from-dark-to-light-in-photoshop; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO7gq_2BvZw; https://i1.wp.com/cbtpsychology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Therapy.jpg; Al-Mohair, H.K., Saleh, J.M., Suandi, S.A., Hybrid human skin detection using neural network and k-means clustering technique (2015) Applied Soft Computing, 33, pp. 337-347; Brand, J., Mason, J.S., A comparative assessment of three approaches to pixel-level human skin-detection (2000) Proceedings 15th International Conference on Pattern Recognition.

This imbalance is because these systems' reliability requirements make the occurrence of an anomaly a rare phenomenon. Hence, most datasets on anomaly detection have a relatively small percentage that captures the anomaly. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have shown promising results in image generation tasks. Therefore, in this research work, we build on conditional GANs (CGAN) to generate plausible distributions of a given profile to solve the challenge of data imbalance in anomaly detection tasks and present a novel framework for anomaly detection. Firstly, we learn the pattern of the minority class data samples using a single class CGAN. Secondly, we use the knowledge base of the single class CGAN to generate samples that augment the minority class samples so that a binary class CGAN can train on the typical and malicious profiles with a balanced dataset. This approach inherently eliminates the bias imposed on algorithms from the dataset and results in a robust framework with improved generalization. Thirdly, the binary class CGAN generates a knowledge base that we use to construct the cluster-based anomaly detector. During testing, we do not use the single class CGAN, thereby providing us with a lean and efficient algorithm for anomaly detection that can do anomaly detection on semi-supervised and non-parametric multivariate data.We test the framework on logs and image-based anomaly detection datasets with class imbalance.We compare the performance of AD-CGAN with GAN-derived and non-GAN-derived state of the art algorithms on benchmark datasets. AD-CGAN outperforms most of the algorithms in the standard metrics of Precision, Recall, and F-1 Score. Where AD-CGAN does not perform better in the parameters used, it has the advantage of being lightweight. Therefore, it can be deployed for both online and offline anomaly detection tasks since it does not use an input sample inversion strategy. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

However, not all images will have useful information, or be of sufficient quality. Manually sorting these images and selecting useful data are both time consuming and prone to interpreter bias. Deep neural network algorithms are capable of processing large image datasets and can be trained to identify specific targets. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two competing networks, Generator and Discriminator that can analyze, capture, and copy the variations within a given dataset. In this study, we selected a variant of GAN called Conditional-GAN that incorporates an additional label parameter, for identifying epiphytes in photos acquired by a UAV in forests within Costa Rica. We trained the network with 70%, 80%, and 90% of 119 photos containing the target epiphyte, Werauhia kupperiana (Bromeliaceae) and validated the algorithm's performance using a validation data that were not used for training. The accuracy of the output was measured using structural similarity index measure (SSIM) index and histogram correlation (HC) coefficient. Results obtained in this study indicated that the output images generated by C-GAN were similar (average SSIM = 0.89 - 0.91 and average HC 0.97 - 0.99) to the analyst annotated images. However, C-GAN had difficulty to identify when the target plant was away from the camera, was not well lit, or covered by other plants. Results obtained in this study demonstrate the potential of C-GAN to reduce the time spent by botanists to identity epiphytes in images acquired by UAVs. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

We used the differential privacy to ensure the privacy and take both anonymity and utility into consideration. The method consists of the following two parts: Firstly, we designed a graph feature learning method based on GAN. The method used the bias random walk strategy to sample the node sequence from graph data, and trained the GAN model. After training, the GAN generated a set of simulation sequences that are highly like the real sampled sequence. Secondly, we proposed an anonymous graph construction method based on the simulation node sequence. We calculated the number of edges in the node sequences and constructed a probability adjacency matrix. The differential privacy noise is added to get the anonymous probability adjacency matrix. Then we extract the edges from the anonymous matrix and then constructed the anonymous graph. We evaluate our methodology, showing that the model had good feature learning ability through embedding visualization and link prediction experiments, compared with other anonymous graphs. Through experiments such as metric evaluation, community detection, and de-anonymization attack, we proved that the anonymous method we proposed is better than the current mainstream anonymous method. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Differential privacy; Generative Adversarial Networks; Graph data; Privacy preservation","Graph structures; Information systems; Information use; Machine learning; Matrix algebra; Privacy by design; Systems engineering; Adjacency matrices; Adversarial networks; Community detection; Differential privacies; Feature learning; Metric evaluation; Random walk strategies; Sampled sequences; Graph theory",,,,,"2019B010136003

This study presents an improved conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) model to generate virtual nighttime visible imagery using infrared (IR) multiband satellite observations and the brightness temperature difference between the two IR bands in the communication, ocean, and meteorological satellite. For the summer daytime case study with visible band imagery, our multiband CGAN model showed better statistical results [correlation coefficient (CC) = 0.952, bias = -1.752 (in a digital number (DN) unit from 0 to 255, converted from reflectance from 0 to 1), and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) = 26.851 DN] than the single-band CGAN model using a pair of visible and IR bands (CC = 0.916, bias = -4.073 DN, and RMSE = 35.349 DN). The proposed multiband CGAN model performed better than the single-band CGAN model, particularly, in convective clouds and typhoons, because of the sounding effects from the water vapor band. In addition, our multiband CGAN model provided detailed patterns for clouds and typhoons at twilight. Therefore, our results could be used for visible-based nighttime weather analysis of convective clouds and typhoons, using data from next-generation geostationary meteorological satellites. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Clouds; conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN); deep learning; multiband; nighttime; typhoon; visible (VIS)","Clouds; Geostationary satellites; Hurricanes; Image enhancement; Mean square error; Weather satellites; Adversarial networks; Brightness temperature difference; Convective clouds; Correlation coefficient; Geostationary meteorological satellites; Root mean square errors; Satellite observations; Satellite soundings; Satellite imagery; atmospheric modeling; brightness temperature; convective cloud; machine learning; numerical model; satellite data; satellite imagery; typhoon; water vapor",,,,,"KMI2020-00510

However, the nonlinear nature of SI-based phase retrieval process, such as the spatial frequency biases and mixture of different spatial frequency components, usually leads to phase aberrations, in particular in the high spatial frequency components. Recent studies show that nonlinear inversion problems can be efficiently represented by deep neural networks in an end-to-end framework. In this study, we present a deep learning framework for SI-based quantitative phase imaging via the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGANs). A series of structured images paired with the corresponding ground truth of phase images are used to train two competing networks of generator and discriminator. We demonstrate that the GAN-based approach produces sharp and accurate phase image and the structured illumination pattern simultaneously based on our simulation. © 2020 SPIE.","Computational imaging; Deep neural networks; Generative Adversarial Network; Phase retrieval; Structured illumination","Deep learning; Adversarial networks; Computational imaging; High spatial frequency; Learning frameworks; Non linear inversion; Phase retrieval; Quantitative phase imaging; Structured illumination; Deep neural networks",,,,,,,,"Wicker, K., Mandula, O., Best, G., Fiolka, R., Heintzmann, R., Phase optimisation for structured illumination microscopy (2013) Opt.

When datasets are unrepresentative, trained models are prone to bias because they are unable to generalise to real world settings. This is particularly problematic for models trained in specific cultural contexts, which may not represent a wide range of races, and thus fail to generalise. This is a particular challenge for driver drowsiness detection, where many publicly available datasets are unrepresentative as they cover only certain ethnicity groups. Traditional augmentation methods are unable to improve a model's performance when tested on other groups with different facial attributes, and it is often challenging to build new, more representative datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that boosts the performance of detection of drowsiness for different ethnicity groups. Our framework improves Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained for prediction by using Generative Adversarial networks (GAN) for targeted data augmentation based on a population bias visualisation strategy that groups faces with similar facial attributes and highlights where the model is failing. A sampling method selects faces where the model is not performing well, which are used to fine-tune the CNN. Experiments show the efficacy of our approach in improving driver drowsiness detection for under represented ethnicity groups. Here, models trained on publicly available datasets are compared with a model trained using the proposed data augmentation strategy. Although developed in the context of driver drowsiness detection, the proposed framework is not limited to the driver drowsiness detection task, but can be applied to other applications. © 2013 IEEE.","CNN; GAN; Population bias; visualisation","Deep neural networks; Population statistics; Visualization; Adversarial networks; Augmentation methods; Cultural context; Data augmentation; Driver drowsiness; Population bias; Real world setting; Under-represented; Convolutional neural networks",,,,,,"This work was supported by the University of Kwa-Zulu Natal.",,"https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2018/English-Summary-GSRRS2018.pdf, Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018.

We propose to use only in-domain (IND) sentences to build a generative adversarial network (GAN) of which the discriminator generates low scores for OOD sentences. To improve basic GANs, we apply feature matching loss in the discriminator, use domain-category analysis as an additional task in the discriminator, and remove the biases in the generator. Thereby, we reduce the huge effort of collecting OOD sentences for training OOD detection. For evaluation, we experimented OOD detection on a multi-domain dialog system. The experimental results showed the proposed method was most accurate compared to the existing methods. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Adversarial networks; Dialog systems; Domain detections; Feature matching; Multi domains; Natural language processing systems",,,,,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP: IITP-2018-2015-0-00742

The widely used bot detection method based on machine learning leads to an imbalance in the number of samples in different categories. Classifier bias leads to a low detection rate of minority samples. Therefore, we propose an improved conditional generative adversarial network (improved CGAN) to extend imbalanced data sets before applying training classifiers to improve the detection accuracy of social bots. To generate an auxiliary condition, we propose a modified clustering algorithm, namely, the Gaussian kernel density peak clustering algorithm (GKDPCA), which avoids the generation of data-augmentation noise and eliminates imbalances between and within social bot class distributions. Furthermore, we improve the CGAN convergence judgment condition by introducing the Wasserstein distance with a gradient penalty, which addresses the model collapse and gradient disappearance in the traditional CGAN. Three common oversampling algorithms are compared in experiments. The effects of the imbalance degree and the expansion ratio of the original data on oversampling are studied, and the improved CGAN performs better than the others. Experimental results comparing with three common oversampling algorithms show that the improved CGAN achieves the higher evaluation scores in terms of F1-score, G-mean and AUC. © 2013 IEEE.","conditional generative adversarial networks; data augmentation; imbalanced data; Social bot detection; supervised classification","Botnet; Classification (of information); Supervised learning; Adversarial networks; Data augmentation; Imbalanced data; Social bots; Supervised classification; Clustering algorithms",,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality: 4202002

The framework takes advantage of the improvements in spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions of the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the GOES-16 platform along with elevation information to improve the precipitation estimates. The procedure begins by first deriving a Rain/No Rain (R/NR) binary mask through classification of the pixels and then applying regression to estimate the amount of rainfall for rainy pixels. A Fully Convolutional Network is used as a regressor to predict precipitation estimates. The network is trained using the non-saturating conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss terms to generate results that better learn the complex distribution of precipitation in the observed data. Common verification metrics such as Probability Of Detection (POD), False Alarm Ratio (FAR), Critical Success Index (CSI), Bias, Correlation and MSE are used to evaluate the accuracy of both R/NR classification and real-valued precipitation estimates. Statistics and visualizations of the evaluation measures show improvements in the precipitation retrieval accuracy in the proposed framework compared to the baseline models trained using conventional MSE loss terms. This framework is proposed as an augmentation for PERSIANN-CCS (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Network- Cloud Classification System) algorithm for estimating global precipitation. © 2019 by the authors.","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); Generative adversarial networks (GANs); Machine learning; Multispectral satellite imagery; Precipitation","Classification (of information); Convolution; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mean square error; Neural networks; Pixels; Precipitation (chemical); Rain; Remote sensing; Adversarial networks; Cloud classification systems; Convolutional neural network; Multispectral satellite imagery; Precipitation estimation; Precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information; Precipitation retrievals; Probability of detection; Satellite imagery",,,,,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE: DE-IA0000018

In these cases, external imaging data or morphological imaging data are normally used for the generation of attenuation maps. Newly introduced machine learning methods however may allow for direct estimation of attenuation maps from non attenuation-corrected PET data (PETNAC). Our purpose was thus to establish and evaluate a method for independent AC of brain fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET images only based on PETNAC using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After training of the deep learning GAN framework on a paired training dataset of PETNAC and the corresponding CT images of the head from 50 patients, pseudo-CT images were generated from PETNAC of 40 validation patients, of which 20 were used for technical validation and 20 stemming from patients with CNS disorders were used for clinical validation. Pseudo-CT was used for subsequent AC of these validation data sets resulting in independently attenuation-corrected PET data. RESULTS: Visual inspection revealed a high degree of resemblance of generated pseudo-CT images compared to the acquired CT images in all validation data sets, with minor differences in individual anatomical details. Quantitative analyses revealed minimal underestimation below 5% of standardized uptake value (SUV) in all brain regions in independently attenuation-corrected PET data compared to the reference PET images. Color-coded error maps showed no regional bias and only minimal average errors around ±0%. Using independently attenuation-corrected PET data, no differences in image-based diagnoses were observed in 20 patients with neurological disorders compared to the reference PET images.

In the last few years, the importance of improving the training of neural networks using semi-supervised training has been demonstrated for classification problems. We present a novel loss function, called feature contrasting, resulting in a discriminator which can distinguish between fake and real data based on feature statistics. This method avoids potential biases and limitations of alternative approaches. The generalization of semi-supervised GANs to the regime of regression problems of opens their use to countless applications as well as providing an avenue for a deeper understanding of how GANs function. We first demonstrate the capabilities of semi-supervised regression GANs on a toy dataset which allows for a detailed understanding of how they operate in various circumstances. This toy dataset is used to provide a theoretical basis of the semi-supervised regression GAN. We then apply the semi-supervised regression GANs to a number of real-world computer vision applications: age estimation, driving steering angle prediction, and crowd counting from single images. We perform extensive tests of what accuracy can be achieved with significantly reduced annotated data. Through the combination of the theoretical example and real-world scenarios, we demonstrate how semi-supervised GANs can be generalized to regression problems. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Age estimation; Generative adversarial learning; Regression","Image understanding; Software engineering; Adversarial learning; Adversarial networks; Age estimation; Computer vision applications; Real-world scenario; Regression; Regression problem; Semi-supervised trainings; Regression analysis",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1137172, 1737533, 1827505

We propose a novel auxiliary classifier GAN that strives for demographic parity or equality of opportunity and show empirical results on several datasets, including the CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) dataset, the Quick, Draw! dataset, and a dataset of soccer player images and the offenses for which they were called. The proposed formulation is well suited to absorbing unlabeled data; we leverage this to augment the soccer dataset with the much larger CelebA dataset.

In the last several years, the importance of improving the training of neural networks using semi-supervised training has been thoroughly demonstrated for classification problems. This work presents a dual-goal GAN which seeks both to provide the number of individuals in a densely crowded scene and distinguish between real and generated images. This method allows the dual-goal GAN to benefit from unlabeled data in the training process, improving the predictive capabilities of the discriminating network compared to the fully-supervised version of the network. Typical semi-supervised GANs are unable to function in the regression regime due to biases introduced when using a single prediction goal. Using the proposed approach, the amount of data which needs to be annotated for dense crowd counting can be significantly reduced. © 2019 IEEE Computer Society.

Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GAN), we present fairness-aware generative adversarial networks, called FairGAN, which are able to learn a generator producing fair data and also preserving good data utility. Compared with the naive fair data generation models, FairGAN further ensures the classifiers which are trained on generated data can achieve fair classification on real data. Experiments on a real dataset show the effectiveness of FairGAN. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Big data; Data mining; Adversarial networks; Data generation; Data generation models; Good data; Training data; Classification (of information)",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1564250, 1646654, 1841119","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by NSF 1564250, 1646654 and 1841119.","This work was supported in part by NSF 1564250, 1646654 and 1841119.","Joseph, M., Kearns, M., Morgenstern, J.H., Roth, A., Fairness in learning: Classic and contextual bandits (2016) NIPS; Beutel, A., Chen, J., Zhao, Z., Chi, E.H., Data decisions and theoretical implications when adversarially learning fair representations (2017) FAT/ML; Binns, R., (2017) Fairness in Machine Learning: Lessons from Political Philosophy; Zhang, L., Wu, Y., Wu, X., A causal framework for discovering and removing direct and indirect discrimination (2017) IJCAI; Kamiran, F., Calders, T., Classifying without discriminating (2009) Control and Communication 2009 2nd International Conference on Computer; Data preprocessing techniques for classification without discrimination (2012) Knowledge and Information Systems, 33 (1), pp. 1-33; Feldman, M., Friedler, S., Moeller, J., Scheidegger, C., Venkatasubramanian, S., Certifying and removing disparate impact (2015) KDD; Goodfellow, I.J., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Ozair, S., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., Generative adversarial networks (2014) NIPS; Radford, A., Metz, L., Chintala, S., (2015) Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks; Choi, E., Biswal, S., Malin, B., Duke, J., Stewart, W.F., Sun, J., Generating multi-label discrete patient records using generative adversarial networks (2017) MLHC; Calders, T., Kamiran, F., Pechenizkiy, M., Building classifiers with independency constraints (2009) ICDM Workshops; Dwork, C., Hardt, M., Pitassi, T., Reingold, O., Zemel, R., (2011) Fairness Through Awareness; Wu, Y., Wu, X., Using loglinear model for discrimination discovery and prevention (2016) DSAA; Kamishima, T., Akaho, S., Sakuma, J., Fairness-aware learning through regularization approach (2011) ICDM Workshops; Zafar, M.B., Valera, I., Rodriguez, M.G., Gummadi, K.P., Fairness constraints: Mechanisms for fair classification (2017) AISTATS; Kamiran, F., Calders, T., Pechenizkiy, M., Discrimination aware decision tree learning (2010) ICDM; Hardt, M., Price, E., Srebro, N., Equality of opportunity in supervised learning (2016) NIPS; Zhang, L., Wu, Y., Wu, X., Achieving non-discrimination in data release (2017) KDD; Edwards, H., Storkey, A., (2015) Censoring Representations with an Adversary; Madras, D., Creager, E., Pitassi, T., Zemel, R., (2018) Learning Adversarially Fair and Transferable Representations; Zhang, B.H., Lemoine, B., Mitchell, M., Mitigating unwanted biases with adversarial learning (2018) AIES; Mirza, M., Osindero, S., (2014) Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets; Dheeru, D., Karra, E., (2017) Taniskidou UCI Machine Learning Repository, , University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences; Kingma, D.P., Ba, J., Adam: A method for stochastic optimization (2015) ICLR",,"Song Y.Liu B.Lee K.Abe N.Pu C.Qiao M.Ahmed N.Kossmann D.Saltz J.Tang J.He J.Liu H.Hu X.","Baidu;et al.;Expedia Group;IEEE;IEEE Computer Society;Squirrel AI Learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2018","10 December 2018 through 13 December 2018",,144531,,9781538650356,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

It's known challenging due to the feature distribution bias between the source domain and target domain. The previous methods directly reduce the bias by image-to-image style translation between the source and the target domain in an unsupervised manner. However, these methods only consider the rough bias between the source domain and the target domain but neglect the detailed bias between the source domain and the target camera domains (divided by camera views), which contain critical factors influencing the testing performance of re-ID model. In this work, we particularly focus on the bias between the source domain and the target camera domains. To overcome this problem, a multi-domain image-to-image translation network, termed Identity Preserving Generative Adversarial Network (IPGAN) is proposed to learn the mapping relationship between the source domain and the target camera domains. IPGAN can translate the styles of images from the source domain to the target camera domains and generate many images with styles of target camera domains. Then the re-ID model is trained with the translated images generated by IPGAN. During the training of the re-ID model, we aim to learn the discriminative feature. We design and train a novel re-ID model, termed IBN-reID, in which Instance and Batch Normalization block (IBN-block) are introduced. Experimental results on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17 show that the images generated by IPGAN are more suitable for cross-domain re-ID. Very competitive re-ID accuracy is achieved by our method. © 2013 IEEE.","domain adaptation; Person re-identification; style transfer; unsupervised learning","Adversarial networks; Critical factors; Discriminative features; Feature distribution; Image translation; Mapping relationships; Person re identifications; Testing performance; Cameras",,,,,"20170204020GX

Meanwhile, recent research showed that fairness should be studied from the causal perspective, and proposed a number of fairness criteria based on Pearl's causal modeling framework. In this paper, we investigate the problem of building causal fairness-aware generative adversarial networks (CFGAN), which can learn a close distribution from a given dataset, while also ensuring various causal fairness criteria based on a given causal graph. CFGAN adopts two generators, whose structures are purposefully designed to reflect the structures of causal graph and interventional graph. Therefore, the two generators can respectively simulate the underlying causal model that generates the real data, as well as the causal model after the intervention. On the other hand, two discriminators are used for producing a close-to-real distribution, as well as for achieving various fairness criteria based on causal quantities simulated by generators. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that CFGAN can generate high quality fair data. © 2019 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

We generate virtual stains and exploit the additional information during segmentation. Specifically a very basic pixel-based segmentation approach is applied in order to focus on the information content available on pixel-level and to avoid any bias which might be introduced by more elaborated techniques. The results of this proof-of-concept trial indicate a performance gain compared to segmentation with the source stain only.

Although sequence-to-sequence models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in abstractive summarization, the training strategy (MLE) suffers from exposure bias in the inference stage. This discrepancy between training and inference makes generated summaries less coherent and accuracy, which is more prominent in summarizing long articles. To address this issue, we model abstractive summarization using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), aiming to minimize the gap between generated summaries and the ground-truth ones. This framework consists of two models: a generator that generates summaries, a discriminator that evaluates generated summaries. Reinforcement learning (RL) strategy is used to guarantee the co-training of generator and discriminator. Besides, motivated by the nature of summarization task, we design a novel Triple-RNNs discriminator, and extend the off-the-shelf generator by appending encoder and decoder with attention mechanism. Experimental results showed that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models, especially on long text corpus. © 2018 IEEE.","Deep learning; Reinforcement learning; Sequence Generative Adversarial Network; Text Summarization","Deep learning; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Adversarial networks; Attention mechanisms; Inference stages; State of the art; State-of-the-art performance; Text summarization; Training framework; Training strategy; Text processing",,,,,,,,"Nallapati, R., Zhou, B., Dos Santos, C., Gulçehre Ç.glar, Xiang, B., Abstractive text summarization using sequence-to-sequence rnns and beyond (2016) CoNLL 2016, p. 280; Chopra, S., Auli, M., Rush, A.M., Abstractive sentence summarization with attentive recurrent neural networks (2016) Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pp. 93-98; Bengio, S., Vinyals, O., Jaitly, N., Scheduled sampling for sequence prediction with recurrent neural networks (2015) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1171-1179; Wang, S., Zhao, X., Li, B., Integrating extractive and abstractive models for long text summarization (2017) Big Data (BigData Congress), 2017 IEEE International Congress On.

However, the discriminator typically results in the instability of the GAN training due to the inadequate training problem: the search space is so huge that sampled translations are not sufficient for discriminator training. To address this issue and stabilize the GAN training, in this paper, we propose a novel Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network for Neural Machine Translation (BGAN-NMT), which aims to introduce a generator model to act as the discriminator, whereby the discriminator naturally considers the entire translation space so that the inadequate training problem can be alleviated. To satisfy this property, generator and discriminator are both designed to model the joint probability of sentence pairs, with the difference that, the generator decomposes the joint probability with a source language model and a source-to-target translation model, while the discriminator is formulated as a target language model and a target-to-source translation model. To further leverage the symmetry of them, an auxiliary GAN is introduced and adopts generator and discriminator models of original one as its own discriminator and generator respectively. Two GANs are alternately trained to update the parameters. Experiment results on German-English and Chinese-English translation tasks demonstrate that our method not only stabilizes GAN training but also achieves significant improvements over baseline systems. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Computer aided language translation; Natural language processing systems; Adversarial networks; Baseline systems; Generator modeling; Joint probability; Machine translations; Source language; Target language; Translation models; Computational linguistics",,,,,,,,"Arjovsky, M., Chintala, S., Bottou, L., Wasserstein gagn (2017) CoRR; Artetxe, M., Labaka, G., Agirre, E., Cho, K., Unsupervised neural machine translation (2017) CoRR; Bahdanau, D., Brakel, P., Xu, K., Goyal, A., Lowe, R., Pineau, J., Courville, A.C., Bengio, Y., An actor-critic algorithm for sequence prediction (2016) CoRR; Bahdanau, D., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate (2014) CoRR; Bengio, S., Vinyals, O., Jaitly, N., Shazeer, N., Scheduled sampling for sequence prediction with recurrent neural networks (2015) NIPS; Cheng, Y., Xu, W., He, Z., He, W., Wu, H., Sun, M., Liu, Y., Semi-supervised learning for neural machine translation (2016) ACL; Chiang, D., Hierarchical phrase-based translation (2007) Computational Linguistics, 33, pp. 201-228; Cho, K., van Merrienboer, B., Gulçehre, Ç., Bahdanau, D., Bougares, F., Schwenk, H., Bengio, Y., Learning phrase representations using rnn encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation (2014) EMNLP; Gehring, J., Auli, M., Grangier, D., Yarats, D., Dauphin, Y., Convolutional sequence to sequence learning (2017) ICML; Glorot, X., Bengio, Y., Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks (2010) AISTATS; Goodfellow, I.J., Nips 2016 tutorial: Generative adversarial networks (2016) CoRR; Goodfellow, I.J., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., Courville, A.C., Bengio, Y., Generative adversarial nets (2014) NIPS; Hassan, H., Aue, A., Chen, C., Chowdhary, V., Clark, J., Federmann, C., Huang, X., Zhou, M., Achieving human parity on automatic chinese to english news translation (2018) CoRR; He, D., Xia, Y., Qin, T., Wang, L., Yu, N., Liu, T.-Y., Ma, W.-Y., Dual learning for machine translation (2016) NIPS; Hochreiter, S., Schmidhuber, J., Long short-term memory (1997) Neural Computation; Koehn, P., Och, F.J., Marcu, D., Statistical phrase-based translation (2003) HLTNAACL; Lamb, A., Goyal, A., Zhang, Y., Zhang, S., Courville, A.C., Bengio, Y., Professor forcing: A new algorithm for training recurrent networks (2016) NIPS; Lample, G., Ott, M., Conneau, A., Denoyer, L., Ranzato, M., Phrase-based & neural unsupervised machine translation (2018) CoRR; Li, J., Monroe, W., Shi, T., Ritter, A., Jurafsky, D., Adversarial learning for neural dialogue generation (2017) EMNLP; Luong, T., Sutskever, I., Le, Q.V., Vinyals, O., Zaremba, W., Addressing the rare word problem in neural machine translation (2015) ACL; Ma, X., Yin, P., Liu, J., Neubig, G., Hovy, E.H., Soft-max q-distribution estimation for structured prediction: A theoretical interpretation for raml (2017) CoRR; Papineni, K., Roucos, S.E., Ward, T., Zhu, W.-J., BLEU: A method for automatic evaluation of machine translation (2002) ACL; Radford, A., Metz, L., Chintala, S., (2015) Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, , arXiv preprint; Ranzato, M., Chopra, S., Auli, M., Zaremba, W., Sequence level training with recurrent neural networks (2015) CoRR; Sennrich, R., Haddow, B., Birch, A., Improving neural machine translation models with monolingual data (2016) ACL; Shen, S., Cheng, Y., He, Z., He, W., Wu, H., Sun, M., Liu, Y., Minimum risk training for neural machine translation (2016) ACL; Sutskever, I., Vinyals, O., Le, Q.V., Sequence to sequence learning with neural networks (2014) NIPS; Tu, Z., Liu, Y., Shang, L., Liu, X., Li, H., Neural machine translation with reconstruction (2017) AAAI; Vaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A.N., Kaiser, L., Polosukhin, I., Attention is all you need (2017) NIPS; Wiseman, S., Rush, A.M., Sequence-to-sequence learning as beam-search optimization (2016) EMNLP; Wu, L., Xia, Y., Zhao, L., Tian, F., Qin, T., Lai, J.-H., Liu, T.-Y., Adversarial neural machine translation (2017) CoRR; Yang, Z., Chen, W., Wang, F., Xu, B., Improving neural machine translation with conditional sequence generative adversarial nets (2017) CoRR; Yu, L., Zhang, W., Wang, J., Yu, Y., SeqGan: Sequence generative adversarial nets with policy gradient (2017) AAAI",,,"Google Inc.;Textkernel","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","22nd Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, CoNLL 2018","31 October 2018 through 1 November 2018",,150065,,9781948087728,,,"English",,Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072935809
